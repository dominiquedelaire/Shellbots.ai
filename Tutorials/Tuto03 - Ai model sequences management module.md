# Tuto 03 - Ai model sequences management module
> Version 2024.03.08.2, Author : Dominique Delaire


This module **is part of a series of 4 other modules which constitute the Shellbots OS and framework for creating innovative AI services.**

In this tutorial, we will detail the operation of **the first module and which concerns the management of the sequencing of shellbot AI models**.

## Here is a representative diagram of the first module in shellbots (click to expand) :

## Integration of market AI models
* The advantage of shellbots for designing AI services or projects is that it does not use only 1 engine but all the AI ​​engines on the market from different fields and sectors. 
* When a new AI engine is available, we can quickly integrate it into the framework with basic functions from the shellbots environment.
* The objective is to be able to use the strength of each of them in areas where they are most efficient by managing the scoring of the results
* Functions also allow you to save different API keys for the same engine depending on your needs.
* We have integrated more than 70 AI engines including mistral, google gemini, openai, Microsoft Copilot, claude.ai, etc. and we add more regularly.

## Definition of AI models
* Here, we are not talking about models in machine learning (we have a specific module for that), but about AI models for each AI engine on the market.
* We can create a multitude of models per domain for one or more AI engines on the market based on customer needs and build a large library for creating AI services for our customers.
* The integration is done with the Python language to build a model inside shellbots :
   * For example, here is a type of hello world to create a simple model from the OpenAI market engine to generate sample datas for your applications or databases :

   * We have integrated shellbot constants and functions into the python code to interact with market AI engines and all shellbot modules.
   * Of course, there are very sophisticated models that allow generative AI to be mixed with machine learning and process automation.
