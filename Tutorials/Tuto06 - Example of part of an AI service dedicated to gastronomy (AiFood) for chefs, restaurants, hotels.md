# Tuto 06 - Example of part of an AI service dedicated to gastronomy (AiFood) for chefs, restaurants, hotels
> Version 2024.04.11.1, Author : Dominique Delaire


**This example is one of around twenty services available for restaurants, chefs, hotels, caterers, etc. with our AI service AiFood created with our shellbots framework.**

**In the rendering that you will see in the video demonstration (at the end of this post), terminal or scientific mode is used.**   
The user can access their service via the web in a graphical interface. Here, rendering is for testing the service before final deployment.

## Introduction
In shellbots, we can add and create AI models from over 70 AI engines on the market. In AiFood, we use several types including generative AI including the generation of recipes, decoration images or presentation of dishes. When we create an AI model for a specific service, we can use an associated machine learning data model. For example, having a base or a dictionary of tastes and flavors or the DNA of plants/vegetables for example.

## Examples of a basic AI model 
**First example :** 
* Here, to create one of the 20 functions of AIFood, we established an Ai stability model to generate simple images of decorations which act as a preselection for the chef.
* The advantage in designing a shellbot AI model is to be able to integrate functions from the shellbots framework by combining python code.
* An AI model in the AiFood context defines one or more functions of the AI ​​service.
* You can create as many models as you want and associate them with ML models to increase the relevance of the result.
* Example of basic Ai model with stability model without specific parameters :

**Second example :**
* The user can converse or suggest ideas about a recipe or a search for a dish and one of the models can suggest things based on an ml model with a comic on the DNA of vegetables for example.
* In these cases, the model will also use an llm engine if we define it in the ia model
* Example of case :
