> Version 2024.03.29.2, Author : Dominique Delaire


This module **is part of a series of 4 other modules which constitute the Shellbots OS and framework for creating innovative AI services.**

In this tutorial, we will detail the operation of **the 4th module and which concerns the deployment of ai services created with shellbots for our customers**.

## OS Shellbots Virtual Machine
* Our OS, encapsulated in a VirtualBox virtual machine, is based on a modified Linux Mint distribution. We have changed the boot sequences, the graphical interface as well as the basic programs which are dedicated to AI.
* We created a framework in Python and integrated market AI engines, market machine learning engines as well as specific tools to create AI services and thus have accelerator tools.
* This virtual machine and os can run on Windows 10, Windows 11, macOS X and Linux OS. It is not possible to run it at the moment with the latest processors M1, M2, M3 from apple (intel only)
* Each AI service created with the framework is integrated into a context which therefore has specific vector databases, specific models, etc.
    
## OS Optimized Shellbots Virtual Machine for Customer
* Once the AI ​​service is created for the client's specific needs and tested, we can generate an optimized OS image with only the objects and engines dependent on the created AI service.
* At this stage, we can also enter all the enterprise version API keys for the AI ​​engines or others specific to the customer.
* We can also wait for the delivery stage and add these keys in the target environment of use.
* Add connections to source data to link to production data.

## Delivery on differents platforms
* The AI ​​service can be delivered on different platforms :
  * A virtual machine hosted on Google Cloud
  * A virtual machine hosted on Microsoft Azure
  * A virtual machine hosted on Amazon Cloud Ec2
  * Containers such as Docker, VmWare, ...
  * And the same technology as source : virtual box on Windows, Linux or MacOS.
