# Tuto 08 - Scoring of Ai engines with shellbots
> Version 2024.05.02.1, Author : Dominique Delaire

## Introduction
**This tutorial helps to understand how we can score between different AI engines to compare them and see where they excel in a specific area**

**For some of our clients, and before developing specific AI services with the shellbots framework and accelerator platform, we can determine which are the best AI engines on the market depending on the client's domain or need.**

**To perform scoring or matches between AI engines in shellbots, we have 2 methods, a manual method and a method controlled by our internal inference engine**

## Scoring AI engines using the manual method

The manual method involves building AI shellbot models to manually evaluate the results of different AI engines following prompts in the client's specialized areas. For example, for dietetics, we could hire a nutritionist for a few weeks to evaluate the results on different specific prompts for the client.
