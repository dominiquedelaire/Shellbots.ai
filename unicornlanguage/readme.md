> - I created **`Unicorn language`** for shellbots to **`create quickly GUI interface for IA Services`**. You can use Unicorn also to **`create GUI for game, audio, machine learning, health solutions, etc.`**   
> - No need to know Python or specific library. Solutions created with Unicorn can be run on linux, windows, macos, shellbotsos, and cloud platforms (azure, amazon, etc.).  
> - **`Compile to get in real time Python / dearpygui code ready to execute for your shellbots ia services.`**
