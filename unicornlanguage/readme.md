> I created **`Unicorn language`** for shellbots to **create quickly GUI interface for IA Services**. You can use Unicorn also to **create GUI for game, audio, machine learning, health solutions, etc.**   
> No need to know Python or specific library. Solutions created with Unicorn can be run on linux, windows, macos, shellbotsos, and cloud platforms (azure, amazon, etc.). **You define GUI with block and nodes.**
